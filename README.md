Electronic Health Records Data Analysis for  Hospital Admissions and Patient Data

A comprehensive introduction to Electronic Health Record (EHR) data analysis using Python. 
Demonstrates a typical workflow, from simulating complex healthcare data to performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and building machine learning models to predict critical patient outcomes.

Why EHR Data Analysis?
Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are a rich source of information that can revolutionize healthcare. By analyzing EHR data, we can:

1. Identify patterns in diseases and treatments.

2. Predict patient risks (e.g., hospital readmission, mortality).

3. Optimize hospital operations and resource allocation.

4. Support clinical decision-making.

5. Advance medical research and public health initiatives
